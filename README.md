## Introduction
It is almost impossible to find a purely British-English dictionary or word 
list. By default, Oxford and Cambridge include US/CAD/AUS English variants and 
references in their published dictionaries and on their websites. Further, what 
is often labelled as 'en-GB' is almost always, in fact, International English.
