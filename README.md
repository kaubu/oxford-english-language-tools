## Introduction
It is almost impossible to find a purely Oxford-English dictionary or word 
list. By default, British spellcheckers include UK/USA/AUS/NZ English variants
and references in their published dictionaries and on their websites. Further,
what is often labelled as 'en-GB' is almost always, in fact, International
English.
